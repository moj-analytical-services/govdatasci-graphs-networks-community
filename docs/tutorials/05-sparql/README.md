This session started with some discussion of graph databases and when they can be useful. The second part looked at ways to query them, and focused on introducing Sparql.

Sparql is a query language for RDF-based graph databases. This notebook contains code for making Sparql queries with Python, plus some examples that connect to the Wikidata endpoint. There are also some questions to practise writing your own queries. I've included links to sample answers, but as usual, there are lots of alternative ways to answer them.
