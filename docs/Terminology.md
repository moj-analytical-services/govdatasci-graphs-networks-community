# Graphs and Networks Terminology

### Terminology

Like any discipline, graphs/networks come with their own set of nomenclature. The following descriptions are intentionally simplifiedâ€”more mathematically rigorous definitions can be found in any graph theory textbook.

- **Graph/Network**: A data structure `G = (V, E)` where `V` and `E` are a set of vertices/nodes and edges/links.
- **Vertex/Node**: Represents a single entity such as a person or an object.
- **Edge**: Represents a relationship between two vertices (e.g., are these two vertices friends on a social network?).
- **Directed Graph vs. Undirected Graph**: Denotes whether the relationship represented by edges is symmetric or not.
- **Weighted vs Unweighted Graph**: 
    - In weighted graphs, edges have a weight that could represent the cost of traversing or a similarity score or a distance score.
    - In unweighted graphs, edges have no weight and simply show connections, example: course prerequisites.
- **Subgraph**: A set of vertices and edges that are a subset of the full graph's vertices and edges.
- **Degree**: A vertex/node measurement quantifying the number of connected edges.
- **Connected Component**: A strongly connected subgraph, meaning that every vertex can reach the other vertices in the subgraph.
- **Shortest Path**: The lowest number of edges/links required to traverse between two specific vertices/nodes.
